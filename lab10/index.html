					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with your partner, experiment with DOM manipulation. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I only ran into one minor problem in this lab. It was not too hard
						to find and got fixed right away. The steps in this assignment were 
						pretty easy to follow along with and were very helpful. The one thing 
						that gave me issues was missing a " }); " Once I found it, the button 
						worked as it should. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> All the JavaScript worked as I wanted it to. Had one problem but it got fixed
						and did not stress me out too much. I made the page match the style of all my other
						labs. I like how my page looks and happy with the results. 
					</p>
