					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this assignmnet went well. It was pretty easy to follow the instructions.
						I did run into a small problem when trying to figure out if the letter was a L or I, but then
						I rembered in class that it was a L. With docwrite I did run into a problem but that was a 
						spelling error that I was able to catch early on.
