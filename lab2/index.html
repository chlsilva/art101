                Hi my name is Chloe, I am a third year Cong. Sci. major and 
                taking this class because I wanted to take an art class. Some 
                hobbies I have is dance and playing tennis. My partner is named 
                Jose. We are both excited to be taking this class and learn more about CSS
                and html. :)  
            </p>
            </div>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>With a partner, create a basic HTML file and a CSS style file, edit it, view it in your browser, and inspect it.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? 
						Some problems that I came across was finding a partner. I did wait till
						the last moments to find a partner.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Put your reflections about this assignment here. How did it go? What kind of energy did you put into the assignment? 
						This assignment was really fun. I enjoyed all the creativity and personizing we are able to do.
						I feel like I put a good amount of energy on this assignment. I did most of the work I can 
						do on my own without a partner and left blanks in the assignment for when I do find one. After I found a 
						partner I was able to share with them the work I did and was bale to help where they needed it.
