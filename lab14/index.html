			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>With a partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Trying to figure out which labs to fix and add onto. All my labs ran without problems so 
						I was able to use this time to add more to them. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>One of the major things I did for old labs was adding images. Most did not
						have any images so now some they do. :) This was a pretty simple lab to do and 
					fun to fix things around. I did some minor styling fixing and changing fonts and colors.
				Overall no major javascript needed to be fixed. Another thing that I added was links to see the javascript source 
			code on the major javascript assignments. All the links work and show printed out javascript.   </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I fixed parts of lab6 with the javascript and formating</p>
