			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This was the first lab that gave me major problems. This took me 
						a few trys to figure out and I am still not sure if it is 
					done correctly. I had to ask wesbot and look at the example lab posted. I thoght I was having naming problems but 
				that was not the case. I am really not sure what my problems are. In the end I used the nasa image of the day to load 
			a working api and now its all good. </button> 
				 </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I tried to get it to print out what was needed. Does not really work the best 
						and still trying to figure out what to fix. Checked the console for help but still 
						can't find it. 
					</p>
