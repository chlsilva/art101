					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a lot more problmes then I would have liked to have. The buttons
						were not working even after following the directions given. For some reason I had two
					button apear when trying to make only one. After lots of testing and debuging something worked
				and now the buttons work!  </p>

			<div id="reflection" >
				
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think that this assignment gave me the most problmes then all the other 
						ones. I was able to get my problem fixed by using w3schools for some help.
						Overall I am happy that I was bale to get my problem fixed but I do feel 
						that the instuctions in the assignment could be more clear because I can see how someone can get 
						easily lost. I do feel more comfortable understanding jQuery.
