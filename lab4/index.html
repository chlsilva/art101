			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding 
						before jumping into coding. With your partner, pseudocode 
						an everyday task most students may not be familiar with. 
						Examples include, changing a tire, making salsa, baking bread, 
						getting an A in a class, or making art. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Trying to figure out which game to do pseudocode for and the steps needed
						for it. Trying to figure out how to format the assignment and what exactly to 
						submit.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was kinda difficult at first when it came to picking a topic to 
						write pseudocode for. Overall it was a simple assignment to follow and did not
						run into too many problems. I mainly used wmodes.github.io/art101/lab4/index.html for
						help on this assignment. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<pre>
						//Pseudocode a simple computer game
						// initialize the game setup
						// choose random word 
						// check letters ued and show the word using _ _ _
						// loop as long as player has lives left
							// display lives remaining
						// ask the current player for another letter
							// checkn if letter has been used
								// add letter to guessed list
							// else:
								// reveal letter on the _ _ _
						// player win or lose and print message
					</pre>
					<div id="output"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Pseudocode an everyday task</h2>
					<pre>
						//making kombucha
						//gather ingredents 
							//tea
							//water
							//sugar
							//SCOBY
							//jar
							//cloth
						//heat up water and steep the tea
						//pour suagr into warm tea
						//let tea cool to room temp and pour into jar
						//add the SCOBY to the jar and cover with cloth
						//leave the jar out of direct sunlight for one week
						//you will have kombucha after one week of waiting!
